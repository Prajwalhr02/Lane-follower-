Motor Driver Connections:
1. Connect the input pins (in1, in2, in3, in4) to the corresponding GPIO pins.
2. Connect the enable pins (en1, en2) to the PWM-capable GPIO pins.
3. in1 = 3, in2 = 5, in3 = 29, in4 = 31, enA = 32 and enB = 33 (GPIO.BOARD mode
refers to the physical pin numbering on the Raspberry Pi's header)
DC Motor Connections:
1. Connect the DC motors to the output terminals of the motor driver.
Power Supply:
1. Connect the +12V input of the L298N to the external power source's positive terminal.
2. Connect the GND input of the L298N to the external power source's negative terminal.
3. Raspberry Pi to power bank
Camera Module:
1. Connect the USB camera to the dedicated camera port on the Raspberry Pi.
